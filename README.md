Washington is an Artifical Intelligence-augmented Security Operations Platform utilizing scripts and automations to amass data that is assessed by the Foundation's AI FAITH to provide actionable insights. 

Washington is made up of the following pieces:  
  FAITH: The LCMS Foundation's own local AI  
  Mercer: Extract data from Taegis XDR  
  Baron: Complete daily nmap scans of the IC network  
  Hale: extract data from Microsoft Graph 
  Evans: extract data from FortiGate specifically to monitor attempts against FAITH itself  
  Warren: extract data from FortiSASE  
  Woodhull: assess data being generated and provide a broad-picture overview of the threat landscape. This is both an automation and a FAITH bot.  
  Dashboard: an interactive dashboard that allows the collected data to be visualized, as well as a interactive chat with Woodhull to gain further insights.  


Evans, Warren, and the Dashboard have yet to be developed. Hale is currently under development.
